      <div class="cont">Barcelona is utterly incomparable. It’s one of a few must-see cities with its<br>own identity. This is partly down to a generation of early-20th-century artists<br> and architects, like Antoni Gaudí, whose unforgettable buildings are like<br> nothing you’ll see anywhere else.
          Barcelona sited between the sea and the<br> mountains, has found a formidable balance: a foot in the traditional things<br> and the other in the avant-garde. Barcelona has the reputation of being the<br> most cosmopolitan, modern and avant-garde city in Spain and it has renewed<br> for the 1992 Olympic Games.
